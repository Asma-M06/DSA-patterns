# DSA Patterns

This repository contains my practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms,
organized by common problem-solving patterns used in technical interviews.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Patterns
- **Two Pointers** → Most array problems
- **Sliding Window** → Most substring problems
- **Hash Map** → Frequency/count-based problems
- **BFS / DFS** → Traversal problems
- **Recursion / Backtracking** → Choice-based problems
- **Trees** → Parent–child relationship problems
- **Graphs (BFS)** → Shortest path problems
- **Dynamic Programming** → Optimization problems

## 💻 Language
- C++

## 🎯 Purpose
To improve problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation for coding interviews.
