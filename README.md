In this we have followed pattern wise dsa learning and solved few commom problems for better understanding 
Most array problems → two pointers
Most substring problems → sliding window
Most “count frequency” problems → hashmap
Most traversal problems → BFS/DFS
Most “choice/explore all” → recursion/backtracking
Most parent-child problems → trees
Most shortest path problems → graph + BFS
Most optimization problems → DP
